EmailSanitizor
==============

EmailSanitizor alters email addresses to your pre-designated email address right before it is delivered,  so you won't accidently send out testing emails
to your customers. 

Example
=======

add your designated email address to base_email in your config file
EmailSanitizor.options[:base_email] = 'eric@example.com'

usage:
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  include EmailSanitizor
  EmailSanitizor :send_notification, send_bulk_notifications 

  def  send_notification(user)
    @recipients = user.email
  end
   
  def  send_bulk_notifications(company)
    @recipients = company.emails
  end
end
