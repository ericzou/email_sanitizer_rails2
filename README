EmailSanitizor
==============

EmailSanitizor alters email addresses to your pre-designated email address right before it is delivered,  so you won't accidently send out testing emails to your customers. It works by re-route the email back to your email address - for example: email sent to joe@example.com will change to "your_name"+joe_at_example.com@yourdomain.com 

Example
=======

add your designated email address to base_email in your development.rb file

EmailSanitizor.options[:base_email] = 'eric@example.com'

usage:
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  include EmailSanitizor 

  def  send_notification(user)
    @recipients = user.email
  end
   
  def  send_bulk_notifications(company)
    @recipients = company.emails
  end
  
  EmailSanitizor if Rails.env.development? || Rails.env.test?
  # or EmailSanitizor :send_notification, send_bulk_notifications for individual methods
end
